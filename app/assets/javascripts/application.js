// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, or any plugin's
// vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file. JavaScript code in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
//
// IMPORTANT: Rails 5 needs jquery_ujs to perform DELETE requests and confirmation dialogs.
// Use this article to perform these actions without jquery_ujs in order to increase performance since
// jquery_ujs is over 100 kilobytes (minified, not gzipped) of unnecessary JavaScript
